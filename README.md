## MyStyle

This intelligent stylist recommends custom outfits to users based on clothing they already have. Scan an article of clothing, save it to your virtual wardrobe, and style it how you want.


## Tech Stack

- React Native / Tailwind CSS (UI)
- Expo (Node.js runtime environment)
- JupyterLab (Machine Learning Model)
- Firebase (Auth)
- Figma (Design)

## Requirements

IMPORTANT: To ensure proper execution of the app, minimize dependency conflicts within your virtual environment (venv or conda).

    1. Create and activate a virtual environment. Conda is recommended, though any is fine.'
    2. Install Python 3.11.
    3. Install npm or yarn (if you haven't already).
    4. Run the following npm and npx commands to install the libraries, packages, and dependencies necessary to run the app. Following this, you will clone the repo.
        a. npm install [tensorflow and tensorflowjs]
        b. npm install [expo], tailwindcss
        c. npm install firebase
    5. Clone the repo.
    6. Decide how to run the app. You may choose an Android/iOS simulator depending on your system OS, or install the Expo Go app on a mobile device to replicate the UI.
    7. Enter into the console: npx expo start.
